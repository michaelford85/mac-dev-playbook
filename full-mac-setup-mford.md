# Full Mac Setup Process (for Michael Ford)

There are some things in life that just can't be automated... or aren't 100% worth the time :(

This document covers that, at least in terms of setting up a brand new Mac out of the box.

These instructions assume that the playbook and ansible are installed on a remote linux machine.

The default location for all necessary files in Dropbox is: 
- In the Dropbox GUI: `/Dropbox/My Documents/Macbook Ansible Restore`
- On the target Mac: `{{ dropbox_local_path }}/My Documents/Macbook Ansible Restore`
  - Where `{{ dropbox_local_path }}` is the path to the Dropbox folder on the target machine, that you should also specify in the `config.yml` file.

## Initial configuration of a brand new Mac

### Pre-automation Tasks
Before starting, I completed Apple's mandatory macOS setup wizard (creating a local user account, and optionally signing into my iCloud account). Once on the macOS desktop, I do the following (in order):

  - SSH setup.
    - Manually copy the private SSH key that are needed to log into the remote Ansible machine, from Dropbox (via Airdrop or Web GUI) at `/Dropbox/My Documents/SSH keys/Home Lab/fordlab.pem`.
  - Turn on [Remote Login](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/allow-a-remote-computer-to-access-your-mac-mchlp1066/mac) and [Screen Sharing](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/turn-screen-sharing-on-or-off-mh11848/mac) in Settings on Target Mac
  - Ensure that the approprpiate SSH Public key (at `/Dropbox/My Documents/SSH keys/Home Lab/fordlab.pub`) that allows remote access is populated in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the target Mac.
  - Sign into:
    - iCloud
    - iMessage
    - Mac App Store
  - Ensure Apple's command line tools are installed (`xcode-select --install` to launch the installer)
  - Install homebrew:
    - `$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
  - Install the ansible collections and roles required:
    - `$ ansible-galaxy install -r <repository root>/requirements.yml`
  - Specify the privilege escalation password for your target machines. You have several options:
    - Make the playbook query you for the become password when running the main.yml file, with the argument `--ask-become-pass`
    - Specify the `ansible_become_password` variable in the `config.yml` file.
    - If you are running the playbook on multiple macs, and they have different passwords, you can set the inventory variable `ansible_become_pass`.
  - Make the following role tweaks:
    - **<repository root>/roles/geerlingguy.dotfiles/tasks/main.yml**:
      - For the task `Ensure dotfiles repository is cloned locally`, add `force: true` to the git module arguments.
        - ```
            
              - name: Ensure dotfiles repository is cloned locally.
                git:
                  repo: "{{ dotfiles_repo }}"
                  dest: "{{ dotfiles_repo_local_destination }}"
                  version: "{{ dotfiles_repo_version }}"
                  accept_hostkey: "{{ dotfiles_repo_accept_hostkey }}"
                  force: true
                become: false
          ```
    - **<repository root>/roles/ansible-role-dock/tasks/remove.yml**:
      - Comment out the task `Dockutil | Removing items`.
        - ```
              # - name: Dockutil | Removing items
              #   ansible.builtin.shell: "{{ lookup('template', './templates/remove.j2') | replace('\n', '') | trim }}"
              #   loop_control:
              #     label: "{{ item.item }}"
              #   changed_when: false
              #   when: dock_dockitems_to_remove is defined and (dock_dockitems_to_remove | length > 0)
              #   tags:
              #     - dock-remove
          ``` 
            

### Automated Installations

- Ensure that config.yml is in the cloned repository, sourced from Dropbox.
- Run the playbook remotely with `--tags homebrew, sudoers`.
  - `$ ansible-playbook main.yml  --tags "homebrew,sudoers"`
  - If there are errors, you may need to finish up other tasks like installing 'old-fashioned' apps first
- Install old-fashioned apps:
  - Install [Insta360 Link](https://www.insta360.com/download/insta360-link)
  - Install [Google Chat](https://chat.google.com/download/) from within Brave Browser
  - Install [VMWare Fusion Player](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/en/evalcenter?p=fusion-player-personal-13) (dmg file and licence are in DropBox)
- Set up Dropbox and sync the following folders:
  - `{{ dropbox_local_path }}/apps/`
  - `{{ dropbox_local_path }}/My Documents/Macbook Ansible Restore/`
- Run the playbook remotely with `--skip-tags homebrew, post`.
  - `$ ansible-playbook main.yml  --skip-tags "homebrew,post"`
  - NOTE: The Dock may not show updates after this; in order to show the changes, run the following command in the Mac Terminal:
    - `killall Dock`
    - This command will terminate the Dock process, and macOS will automatically restart it. Any changes applied to the Dock should be resolved after this command.
